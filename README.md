# DSPS_CBrown
Repository for DSPS Fall 2025 (PHYS461)

- I wanted to take this class because of how important data science is in every aspect of physics. No matter how elegant or interesting any theory is, physical data is how we actually interact with physics.
- I'm excited to learn about how techniques of machine learning and artificial intelligence are applied to physical problems, I know almost nothing about this.
- I think what will help me the most with this class is my previous experience using python for data science. For my research, I've used pandas in python to handle large data sets.
